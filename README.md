## General info
<br>

* This project is intended to demonstrate the student's knowledge of JavaScript APIs and web development skills through the creation of a quiz, building the foundations of the HTML, CSS and JS. Through the process, the student is able to learn about trial and error, debugging skills (such as looking for syntax errors, undefined entities, etc.) and further solidifying user skills on all three aspects.

## Technologies
Project is created with: <br>

* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript
<br>
<br>

## Resources
* https://www.sitepoint.com/simple-javascript-quiz/ (Basics on how to make a quiz using JS)
* https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp (A how-to on the timer aspect of the quiz)
* https://careerkarma.com/blog/javascript-cannot-set-property-innerhtml-of-null/ (The "Uncaught" error and the closest to a working solution that was able to be found)

<br>
<br>

## Troubleshooting
Multiple issues came up during the completion of this assignment, some of which caused major defects within the final product.  <br>

* A major error throughout the assignment was an error message that was seen only when brought up in the console log:
<br>
"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerText' of null"
<br>
When looking for an answer, a working solution was not able to be found.
<br>
Another issue with the project is the context of the quiz itself: is it supposed to be about JavaScript, or is it supposed to be a quiz with heavy focus on the JavaScript aspects of the assignment?
